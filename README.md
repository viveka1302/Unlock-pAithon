# Under Development
## Unlock-pAithon
Was making LLMs flexible for myself. Might as well open-source it.

### Initial Objective:
- Reduce Vendor Lock-ins for developers by setting up a Unified Interface for interaction with multiple popular LLM APIs.
Currently targeting => OpenAI, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, Anthropic Claude, and Huggingface AIs.

### Later Stage Objectives:
- Make plug & play style modules to facilitate RAGs, Prompt chaining, Prompt templating, Structured outputs for Multi-LLM projects.

Keep it simple, Keep it growing.
